# Contact_Management_System
Develop a C program for contact management with following operations: 
•Define a structure to store information of contacts. 
•Accept information of person while adding new contact or editing it. 
•Edit newly added or existing contacts by accepting information from the user. 
•Display currently added as well as existing contacts. 
•Search information of person- by name, or by phone number. 
•Lastly, Delete contacts by entering the name of the contact - newly added, or existing.

Many times, due to traditional contact management we are unable to keep track of the existing and new contacts. Many visiting cards get misplaced after some time and if the contact details are not saved properly and it is difficult to find them again.
Also, in traditional contact management, it is very hard to find the contacts, to edit them or to destroy or delete them.
In order to overcome all these issues, our team has created a phonebook system where a user can add, edit, search, view and delete existing as well as newly added contacts effortlessly.
